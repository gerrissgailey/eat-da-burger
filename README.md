This is the Eat-Da-Burger app! Designed to be a fun way of demonstrating database functionality such as adding items to a database, displaying them in a starting state, modifying the database item, and deleting the item. In this case, adding a burger to a "Devour" list, then "Devouring" the burgers to move them to a "Devoured" list, and finally the burgers can be deleted from the "Devoured" list and removed from the database.
